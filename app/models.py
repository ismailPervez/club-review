from app import db
from flask_login import UserMixin

'''
we have 2 model classes - User and Review
one user can have multiple reviews
therefore, a user shares one to many relationship with review
__tablename__ = users
__tablename__ = reviews

update:
since our application will allow users to comment on posts,
we will create another table to hold the comments
__tablename__ = 'comments'
this table will have 2 foreign keys, one pointing to the user who created the comment
and the other to the post which has been commented on

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.query.get(int(user_id))

'''
the User class will also inherit from UserMixin class
this class attaches 4 methods

Flask-login requires a User model with the following properties:

    has an is_authenticated() method that returns True if the user has provided
    valid credentials
    has an is_active() method that returns True if the userâ€™s account is active
    has an is_anonymous() method that returns True if the current user is an anonymous user
    has a get_id() method which, given a User instance, returns the unique ID for that object

UserMixin class provides the implementation of this properties.
Its the reason you can call for example is_authenticated to check if login
credentials provide is correct or not instead of having to write a method to do that yourself.
